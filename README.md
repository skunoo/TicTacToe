# TicTacToe Game

This is a simple implementation of the TicTacToe game in Python.

# How to Play

	1.	Run the Python script tictactoe.py.
	2.	Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid.
	3.	The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
	4.	If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
